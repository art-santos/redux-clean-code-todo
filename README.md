# EVERY.IO TODO

Every todo is a very small project who's intend to create a funcional todo application.
It does have some functionalities like: Add and move the todos, changing his state, as asked in the challange.
Also have complete, delete and persist functionalities, added by me.

- As you can see, the red arrow is inactive and the green arrow is used to increase the position of the todo

- The check sign mark the todo as complete. Which means, independently the position of the todo, it is always going to be set to the last position.

- The trash icon deletes the todo.

- You can create how many todos as you want. If you want to check your work later on, just close the window and come back later. All the states are going to be persisted.
